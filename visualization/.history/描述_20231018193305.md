在航班延误的传播中，往往收到多方面影响，其包括地理接近性、天气条件和航空公司日程等各种因素。为了简明地呈现出航班延误传播的特性，并最终呈现在图像上，我们假设了这样一个情景：
首先位于早上八点的时候，美国东部地区的遭受大范围雷暴、强降雨天气，其中两个代表性的机场：JFK和BOS受到显著影响，大部份航班的起飞时间都有一定程度的延误。但是，与此同时，图中的其他机场并未出现明显的延误。
10：30的时候，美国东部地区天气情况有所好转，但是由于早上的延误，JFK和BOS的航班仍然有一定程度的延误。此外由于JFK，BOS到MDW的航班大面积延误，到达MDW的航班也会必然延误，导致MDW的其他航班航班也有一定程度的延误。所以在东部出现恶劣天气的两个半小时后，MDW出现延误传播的现象。
与之相似的是，下午15:00，由于来自东部地区航班延误的原因，MDW起飞的航班的延误同时也造成了到达美国西海岸三座机场的延误。
由此而见，在我们假设的这个场景中，一次由于天气原因造成的延误，会在一定程度上影响到其他机场的航班，而这种影响会随着时间的推移而逐渐减弱。而图中也呈现出了整个动态的传播的过程，由单一延误因素引发的连锁效应，最终导致了整个航班网络的延误。

In the propagation of flight delays, they are often influenced by various factors, including geographic proximity, weather conditions, and airline schedules. To concisely illustrate the characteristics of flight delay propagation and eventually present them graphically, we assume the following scenario:

Initially, at 8:00 in the morning, the eastern United States experiences widespread thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. Two representative airports, JFK and BOS, are significantly affected, leading to a considerable delay in the departure times of most flights. However, simultaneously, the other airports in the graph do not show significant delays.

By 10:30, the weather conditions in the eastern United States have improved, but due to the morning delays, flights from JFK and BOS still experience a certain degree of delay. Additionally, due to the extensive delays from JFK and BOS to MDW, flights arriving at MDW are inevitably delayed, causing a ripple effect on other flights at MDW. Therefore, two and a half hours after adverse weather conditions in the east, MDW experiences the delay propagation.

Similarly, at 15:00 in the afternoon, due to delays in flights from the eastern region, delays in departures from MDW also result in delays in arrivals at three airports (SEA, SFO, SAN) on the west coast of the United States.
