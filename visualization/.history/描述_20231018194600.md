在航班延误的传播中，往往收到多方面影响，其包括地理接近性、天气条件和航空公司日程等各种因素。为了简明地呈现出航班延误传播的特性，并最终呈现在图像上，我们假设了这样一个情景：
首先位于早上八点的时候，美国东部地区的遭受大范围雷暴、强降雨天气，其中两个代表性的机场：JFK和BOS受到显著影响，大部份航班的起飞时间都有一定程度的延误。但是，与此同时，图中的其他机场并未出现明显的延误。
10：30的时候，美国东部地区天气情况有所好转，但是由于早上的延误，JFK和BOS的航班仍然有一定程度的延误。此外由于JFK，BOS到MDW的航班大面积延误，到达MDW的航班也会必然延误，导致MDW的其他航班航班也有一定程度的延误。所以在东部出现恶劣天气的两个半小时后，MDW出现延误传播的现象。
与之相似的是，下午15:00，由于来自东部地区航班延误的原因，MDW起飞的航班的延误同时也造成了到达美国西海岸三座机场的延误。
由此而见，在我们假设的这个场景中，一次由于天气原因造成的延误，会在一定程度上影响到其他机场的航班，而这种影响会随着时间的推移而逐渐减弱。而图中也呈现出了整个动态的传播的过程，由单一延误因素引发的连锁效应，最终导致了整个航班网络的延误。

In the propagation of flight delays, they are often influenced by various factors, including geographic proximity, weather conditions, and airline schedules. To concisely depict the characteristics of flight delay propagation and eventually present them graphically, we assume the following scenario:

Initially, at 8:00 in the morning, the eastern United States experiences widespread thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. Two representative airports, JFK and BOS, are significantly affected, leading to a considerable delay in the departure times of most flights. However, simultaneously, the other airports in the graph do not show significant delays.

By 10:30, the weather conditions in the eastern United States have improved, but due to the morning delays, flights from JFK and BOS still experience a certain degree of delay. Additionally, due to extensive delays from JFK and BOS to MDW, flights arriving at MDW are inevitably delayed, causing a ripple effect on other flights at MDW. Therefore, two and a half hours after adverse weather conditions in the east, MDW experiences the phenomenon of delay propagation.

Similarly, at 15:00 in the afternoon, due to delays in flights from the eastern region, delays in departures from MDW also result in delays in arrivals at three airports on the west coast of the United States.

From this, it is evident that in the assumed scenario, a delay caused by weather conditions will to some extent impact flights at other airports, and this impact gradually diminishes over time. The graph also illustrates the dynamic process of propagation, showcasing the chain reaction triggered by a single delay factor that ultimately leads to delays across the entire flight network.


In the cascade of flight delays, a multitude of factors comes into play, encompassing elements such as geographic proximity, weather conditions, and airline schedules. To succinctly illustrate the dynamics of flight delay propagation and eventually render them graphically, we assume the following scenario:

At 8:00 in the morning, the eastern United States grapples with widespread thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. Two key airports, JFK and BOS, bear the brunt of these adverse conditions, resulting in significant delays for the majority of departing flights. Meanwhile, other airports in the graph exhibit no conspicuous delays.

By 10:30, the weather situation in the eastern United States shows signs of improvement. However, owing to the morning delays, flights departing from JFK and BOS continue to experience some degree of delay. Moreover, the extensive delays from JFK and BOS to MDW trigger a domino effect, causing arriving flights at MDW to unavoidably experience delays. Consequently, this sets off a chain reaction, leading to delays in other flights at MDW. Thus, two and a half hours after the onset of adverse weather conditions in the east, MDW becomes a focal point for delay propagation.

In a similar vein, at 15:00 in the afternoon, delays in departures from MDW, stemming from delays in flights from the eastern region, cascade into delays in arrivals at three airports on the west coast of the United States.

This scenario highlights that in our assumed conditions, a delay prompted by weather factors ripples to some extent across flights at other airports, with this impact gradually diminishing over time. The graph vividly portrays the dynamic process of propagation, showcasing a chain reaction triggered by a singular delay factor that ultimately culminates in delays throughout the entire national flight network.



In the propagation of flight delays, they are often influenced by various factors, including geographic proximity, weather conditions, and airline schedules. To concisely explicate the intricacies of flight delay propagation and subsequently depict them graphically, contemplate the following scenario:

At 8:00 in the morning, the eastern United States contends with pervasive thunderstorms and intense precipitation. Predominantly impacted by these adverse conditions are two pivotal airports, JFK and BOS, yielding consequential delays for a substantial proportion of outbound flights. Concurrently, other nodes in the graph manifest an absence of overt delays.

By 10:30, the meteorological conditions in the eastern United States have improved. However, persisting delays from the morning hours afflict departures from JFK and BOS, inducing a degree of temporal extension. Furthermore, the protracted delays incurred during transit from JFK and BOS to MDW precipitate a cascading effect, compelling inbound flights at MDW to invariably confront delays. Consequently, this initiates a domino effect, resulting in delays for subsequent flights at MDW. Hence, two and a half hours subsequent to the initiation of adverse weather conditions in the east, MDW emerges as a focal locus for the propagation of delays.

Similarly, at 15:00 in the afternoon, delays in outbound flights from MDW, stemming from hindrances in flights departing from the eastern region, finnally cause delays in arrivals at three airports on the west coast of the United States.

This scenario underscores that, under the stipulated conditions, a delay precipitated by meteorological factors reverberates to a certain extent across flights at disparate airports, with the cumulative impact gradually diminishing over temporal progression. The graphical representation illustrate the dynamic process of propagation, unveiling a chain reaction catalyzed by a singular delay factor that ultimately culminates in delays across the entirety of the national flight network.
