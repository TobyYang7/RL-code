In the propagation of flight delays, they are often influenced by various factors, including geographic proximity, weather conditions, and airline schedules. To concisely explicate the intricacies of flight delay propagation and subsequently depict them graphically, we assume the following scenario:

At 8:00 in the morning, the eastern United States contends with pervasive thunderstorms and intense precipitation. Predominantly impacted by these adverse conditions are two pivotal airports, JFK and BOS, yielding consequential delays for a substantial proportion of outbound flights. Concurrently, other nodes in the graph manifest an absence of overt delays.

By 10:30, the meteorological conditions in the eastern United States have improved. However, persisting delays from the morning hours afflict departures from JFK and BOS, inducing a degree of temporal extension. Furthermore, the protracted delays incurred during transit from JFK and BOS to MDW precipitate a cascading effect, compelling inbound flights at MDW to invariably confront delays. Consequently, this initiates a domino effect, resulting in delays for subsequent flights at MDW. Hence, two and a half hours subsequent to the initiation of adverse weather conditions in the east, MDW emerges as a focal locus for the propagation of delays.

Similarly, at 15:00 in the afternoon, delays in outbound flights from MDW, stemming from hindrances in flights departing from the eastern region, finnally cause delays in arrivals at three airports on the west coast of the United States.

This scenario underscores that, under the stipulated conditions, a delay precipitated by meteorological factors reverberates to a certain extent across flights at disparate airports, with the cumulative impact gradually diminishing over temporal progression. The graphical representation illustrate the dynamic process of propagation, unveiling a chain reaction catalyzed by a singular delay factor that ultimately culminates in delays across the entirety of the national flight network.
